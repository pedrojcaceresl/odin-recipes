    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            Make the meat sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned.
            Drain off any excess grease. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
            oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the sauce
            has thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the ricotta filling: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt,
            and pepper. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the lasagna: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread a layer
            of ricotta filling over the noodles. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until
            the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving.
